# @postact/jsx
This adds JSX support to [Postact](https://github.com/AWeirdDev/postact), if you'd like.

It took me forever, so please enjoy this.

You can just add `@postact/jsx` as the JSX input source in your `tsconfig.json`:

```jsonc
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "jsx": "react-jsx",
    "jsxImportSource": "@postact/jsx",
  }
}
```

Then you should be good to go. Maybe. I don't fucking know.
